We have  [previously]({% post_url 2022-07-26-active-geometries %}) seen that the a cross-shaped barrier promotes the localisation of the high density phase of phase separated active Brownian particles in a fashion that depends on the strength of the barrier.

What about the mobility of particles around the barrier?

### Trajectories around the barrier

In 2D it is particularly easy to visualise the trajectories of particles around the barrier

A few observations:

- The barriers **promote longitudinal** motion: stornger barriers are more effective than weaker barriers
- Weak barriers allows for the formation of **dense domains** across the barriers: these move **collectively**, in a way that is influence by the cross-shape of the object (the motion is away from the barrier)
- At low barrier strength the high and low density region display different patterns of motion: at low density the barrier promotes longitudinal motion, at high density much less so.

In simple words, particles **push each other** across the barrier do that transport accurs in the high density phase. Trnasport is however collective, it involves large regions of teh high denisty phase and it is much slower than the free motion in the low density phase. 

I would expect these effets to be even more pronounced in 3D due to the density difference.
