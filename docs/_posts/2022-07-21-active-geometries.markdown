Tuneable repulsive barriers acting on phase-separated active Brownian particles lead to transitions analogous to complete to partial wetting in equilibrium.

The original geometry consisted of a single barrier in an elongated box that promoted phase separation.

Here we explore different geometries, with the aim to stabilise droplet-like structures (if possible).



## Geometry 1: the cross

The simplest modification we consider is to couple two barriers in the x and y direction of the simulation box.
